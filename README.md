# animated-navigation-panel

**animated-navigation-panel** is created using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript developed by [Rob Campbell](https://github.com/robCam/).

This is single page web app to demonstrate a JavaScript prototype for an animated header with revealing navigation tray.
It's all hand crafted custom code to ensure 60fps (#perfmatters). This does not use any JS framework. 

Further documentation for usage, showing configuration options, js methods etc, can be generated using grunt (see below);

You'll need to:

1. Install node.js.
1. Install npm.
1. Run 'npm install'.
1. Run 'grunt dev' to produce a distribution build and 'grunt docs' to generate documentation. (You can also run 'grunt' if you want both the build and documentation).
